					<p>Enlighten the senses in sacred Haridwar during Kumbh Mela, which has been recognised as Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO. Joined by millions of pilgrims for a dip in the blessed River Ganga, Kumbh Mela is the world's largest religious human gathering.Apart from Haridwar, Kumbh Mela is held in Nasik on the bank of River Godavari; Allahabad on the famous confluence of Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati rivers and Ujjain on the bank of River Shipra.</p>
					<p>The origin of the Kumbh is very old and dates back to the time when Kalasha (pot of nectar of immortality) was recovered from Samudra Manthan (during the churning of the primordial sea), for which a tense war between Devtas (Gods) and Asuras (Demons) ensued. To prevent the Amrita Kalasha being forcibly taken into possession by Asuras, who were more powerful than Devtas, its safety was entrusted to the Devtas Brahaspati, Surya, Chandra and Shani. The four Devtas ran away with the Amrita Kalasha to hide it from the Asuras. Learning the conspiracy of Devtas, Asuras turned ferocious and chased the 4 Devtas running with Amrita Kalasha. The chase, lasted 12 days and nights during which the Devtas and Asuras went round the earth and during this chase, Devtas put Amrita Kalasha at Haridwar, Prayag, Ujjain and Nasik.To commemorate this holy event of the Amrita Kalasha 12 years.According to other Pauranik legends, actual fight in the Amrita Kalash being knocked, out of which Amrita being put at 4 places, Kumbh is celebrated every took place between Devtas and Asuras resulting (Nectar) fell down at the above 4 places.Hence,bathing in the water of River Ganga is symbolic to gaining immortality during the Kumbh Mela, and thus, a large number of believers indulge in this act of taking a dip in the river. A number of Akhadas participate in the Kumbh Mela, amongst which the Nagas are the one who get the opportunity to take the first bath. Apart from being one of the most auspicious religious events for all the Hindus worldwide, this Kumbh Mela at Haridwar is always a grand visual feast. It attracts visitors, media, filmmakers, correspondents, writers and the common curious onlookers from the world over. Haridwar Kumbh Mela also holds a record of hosting one of the largest human gatherings in the world, as on 14 April 2010, alone approximately 10 million people were recorded to have bathed in River Ganga.The main and common reason for one to attend the holy festival of Kumbh Mela is to take dip in Holy river, It is said that a holy dip in sacred rivers during Maha Kumbh or Ardh kumbh takes human out of the circle of life & death ( stage known as Moksha ). Pilgrims & Sadhus in great numbers from around the world visit here to liberate themselves. Holy rivers like Ganges , Yamuna & celestial Sarawati at Prayag ( Sangam at Allahabad ) is an age old symbol of Indian Culture & Civilization. These rivers offer purity, wealth, fertility and wash away the sins of those who bath in it. There are many bathing ghats at Haridwar the main ghat is Har Ki Pauri,this ghat was built by Vikramaditya in memory of his brother Bhartrihari. Also known as Brahmakund, the Ghat is magnificently illuminated in the evening during a Maha Aarti performed on this ghat. It is an event which is a must, not be missed by any visitor.</p>
