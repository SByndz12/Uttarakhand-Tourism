									<h2>About The Land of Gods</h2>
									<p>A World Within a State</p>
								</header>
								<hr />
								<p> We invite you to take up a journey to the state of Uttarakhand. We can confidently promise a couple of things. All your expectations would be met and the amazingly diverse and beautiful state would open up countless inconceivable dimensions of travel that might never even have occurred to you.</p>
								<p>If you were to describe a simple word such as ‘beauty’ the Uttarakhand experience might leave you stranded for words. Beauty is so inherent to almost all things Uttarakhand stands for – the magnanimous Himalayas, the holiest of the rivers, the spiritual mystery, stunning landscapes, the incessantly colorful play of nature, enchanting history carved in ancient stones, a mesmerizing floral and faunal plethora and the simplest of the people. Myths, anecdotes and stories are part of every visual that unfolds itself to the eyes of the beholder.</p>
								<p>The age-old Hindu traditions have always accorded highest esteem to the glory of the colossal and composed heights of the Himalayas which are spontaneously assumed to be the chosen consecrated residences of Gods. A whole lot of the Hindu lore sets out from this ‘Land of the Gods’.</p>
								<p>The winter months lay vast and expansive snow-carpets as the slopes, which turn into playgrounds for adventurous snow-revelers to ski amongst the most beautiful of surroundings. Come spring and the land begins to ooze of nascent life with frozen springs making way for the singsong of unsullied streams, waiting buds coming to full blossom creating an outburst of million hues with as many colorful butterflies and insects joining in the chorus. The spring season of Uttarakhand would make you comprehend and probably redefine the word Harmony.</p>
								<p>The streams that originate in the deepest hideaways of the glorious Himalayas of Uttarakhand flow on to feed rivers which have nourished a civilization that has been born and brought up in the Indo-Gangetic soil of the country. These rivers are not just water bodies of enormous proportions, but are also impressive streams commanding worship and reverence with their source in the holy crevices where gods and goddesses reside. The water from the holiest of all Hindu rivers, the Ganga, is believed to wash away and purge the body, mind and soul of all impurity.</p>
								<p>The lush green forests of this region are home to an astounding multiplicity of flora and fauna, some of which fall into the category of endangered species. The wildlife bursts with hundreds and thousands of species, making an exploratory trip to Uttarakhand even more exciting, in the light of the fact that many species are yet to be discovered.</p>
								<p>No words can ever be enough to perfectly describe this blessed land. The incredulous variety of experiences – both spiritual and sensory – goes beyond any language or dialect.</p>
