					<h2 id="byline">By XYZ, Staff Reporter, The Hindu</h2>
					<p>Uttarakhand, 20/06/2013: <br> On 16 June 2013, the State suffered yet another mega disaster, one of the worst disasters in living memory, causing widespread damage and destruction, besides heavy casualties. The entire State was hit by very heavy rainfall and flash floods. Though all the thirteen districts of the State were hit, five districts, namely Bageshwar, Chamoli, Pithoragarh, Rudraprayag and Uttarkashi were the worst affected. The disaster coincided with the peak tourist and pilgrimage season, significantly enhancing the number of the casualties and adversely affecting the rescue and relief operations. </p>
					<p> The impact of disaster was most pronounced in the Mandakini valley of the Rudraprayag district. Torrential rains, coupled with the probable collapse of the Chorabari Lake, led to flooding at the Kedarnath Shrine and the adjacent areas of Rambara, Agastyamuni, Tilwara, and Guptkashi. Other pilgrimage centers in the region, including Gangotri, Yamunotri and Badrinath, which are visited by thousands of devotees during the summer season, were also affected. People in important locations, such as the Harsil, Roopkund and Hemkund Sahib, were stranded for days together. Over one lakh people were stuck in various regions of the State due to damaged roads, landslides and flash flood-induced debris. The disaster essentially occurred due to widespread heavy rains during the period 14-18 June, which resulted in flash floods in all the major river valleys in the State. Heavy rains triggered major landslides at numerous locations causing severe disruption in surface communications. As per the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), the rainfall in the State between 15 June and 18 June 2013 was measured at 385.1 mm, against the normal rainfall of 71.3 mm, which was in excess by 440%. Thus, it can be inferred that the disaster was the result of extra precipitation in a very short duration of time, which resulted in heavy water discharge in various rivers and streams. </p>
